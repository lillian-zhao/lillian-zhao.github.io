        Honkai Impact 3rd is a combat-gacha game created by Chinese game studio Mihoyo (also known as Hoyoverse). There
        are many different ways to enjoy and play Honkai Impact 3rd, and this website will serve as a guide of some
        aspects that I find interesting! </br></br>
        I hope you find this interesting and maybe will give it a try!</br></br>

        <b>Enjoy!</b>
    </p>

<!--For this assignment, I chose to make a website about a game I used to enjoy playing but haven't had time for recently called Honkai Impact 3rd. This game was something that I really
    enjoyed spending my time on and as such I not only already have a lot of background information on it, but also already have a passion for this topic. The website will include aspects
    which I personally find most interesting, which includes the characters and backstory of how the game was made. I created a graph of some of my favorite characters on the "characters" 
    page and some of the aspects which contributes to the gameplay which includes their character type, weapon, and more. 
            Also quick note: I used images from Mihoyo, who are the publishers of Honkai Impact, which they allow 
            based on their fanart/fanwork usage policy detailed on this website: https://www.hoyolab.com/article/1463874 
            Because of this, the images I used technically satisfies the requirement of royalty/copyright free images 
            based on their guidelines I believe? -->
