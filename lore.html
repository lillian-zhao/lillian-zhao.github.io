    <!-- Introduction/header text to lore page-->
    <p class="intro">
        While the game itself has a crazy amount of lore which could probably fill an average young five-part YA novel
        series, it is both too much to talk about on this webpage and many other websites have already discussed the
        extensive story contained within the game. </br></br>
        One aspect of the story of Honkai Impact 3rd which is lesser talked about is the story of the real life studio
        ane people behind this all: Mihoyo (aka Hoyoverse). </br> </br>
        On this page, we will be focusing more on the history of Mihoyo and how they got started from a small studio to
        one of the leading forces in the Open-World and combat-RPG genres today. </br></br>


        <b>Thank you Mihoyo!</b>

        <p class="history">
            MiHoYo, a prominent game studio based in Shanghai, China, was founded in 2012 by Cai Haoyu, known as
            "Yunchang Game" at the time. </br></br>

            MiHoYo's journey began in the realm of mobile gaming, where they quickly gained recognition for their
            exceptional art design and engaging gameplay. Their first major breakthrough came with the release of
            "FlyMe2theMoon" in 2012, a mobile game that showcased their artistic talents.</br></br>

            Their initial success paved the way for their breakthrough moment with the release of "Honkai Impact 3rd" in
            2016. This action-packed, anime-style RPG captivated gamers worldwide with its impressive visuals, complex
            narrative, and dynamic combat system.</br></br>

            "Honkai Impact 3rd" garnered a dedicated fanbase and firmly established MiHoYo as a notable player in the
            gaming industry. </br></br>

            This success set the stage for their subsequent projects, including the highly acclaimed "Genshin Impact,"
            which further solidified MiHoYo's reputation for delivering innovative and immersive gaming experiences.
